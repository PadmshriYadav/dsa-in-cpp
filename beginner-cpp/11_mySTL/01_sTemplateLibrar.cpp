//-----> containers as different kinds of storage boxes for your data.
//vector,list,map
//-----> iterator is how the algorithms know which stuff to work on
//names.begin(), names.end()
//----> Algorithms are the actions, a set of instructions(you write after ".")
// sort algorithm is like a rule that says, "Put all your toys in order from smallest to biggest."


// 1  Include Headers

#include <iostream>   // For printing to the console
#include <vector>     // For the vector container (vector is a dynamic array)
#include <string>     // To use strings
#include <algorithm>  // For the sort and find algorithms
